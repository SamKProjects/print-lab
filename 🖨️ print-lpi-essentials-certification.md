# 🖨️ Printing My LPI Linux Essentials Certificate Using Google Chrome (Windows 11)
This document explains the steps I followed to print my LPI Linux Essentials Certification using Google Chrome on Windows 11.
I downloaded the certificate as a PDF and printed it directly through Chrome’s built‑in PDF viewer.

## 📥 1. Downloaded My LPI Certificate
I logged in to the Linux Professional Institute (LPI) portal and downloaded my certificate as a PDF.
The file saved to:
Downloads\LPI-Essentials-Certificate.pdf
[LE (1).pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/25508178/LE.1.pdf)


## 📄 2. Opened the Certificate in Google Chrome
Instead of using Edge or any other viewer, I opened the PDF in Google Chrome.
How I opened it:

Opened Google Chrome
Pressed Ctrl + O
Selected:
LPI-Essentials-Certificate.pdf


Chrome displayed the certificate using its built‑in PDF viewer

I could also drag and drop the PDF into Chrome.

## 🖨️ 3. Opened Chrome’s Print Menu
With the certificate PDF open in Chrome, I pressed:
Ctrl + P

Or clicked the printer icon in the top‑right of Chrome’s PDF viewer.
This opened Chrome’s print preview.

## 🖨️ 4. Selected My Printer
Under Destination, I chose:
HP DeskJet 2800 series

I confirmed that the printer was online and connected to Wi‑Fi.

## 🔧 5. Adjusted Print Settings
To ensure the certificate printed correctly, I set:
✔ Color: Black & white
Because the uses alot more ink.
✔ Scale: Fit to papper
Fit the cert onto the papper without cut-off.
✔ DPI: 300 DPI is standard for certificates.
It ensures text, borders, and logos are sharp.

## 🖨️ 6. Printed the Certificate
After confirming settings, I clicked:
Print

Chrome sent the PDF to the printer, and the certificate printed successfully.

## 🧪 Troubleshooting Notes (Chrome-Specific)

❗ PDF prints blank or partial pages
Chrome sometimes has issues with certain PDFs.
Fix:

Close Chrome
Reopen Chrome
Reopen the PDF
Print again
OR download the PDF again from LPI


❗ Chrome cannot see the printer
I checked:
Windows 11
Settings → Bluetooth & devices → Printers & scanners

If the printer wasn’t listed there, Chrome won’t show it either.

❗ Printing wont print
I checked:
Printer Ink,
Paper supply,
Print is not flashing,
Printer cover (ensuring it wasn’t blocking paper out



## ✅ Result
I successfully printed my LPI Linux Essentials certificate in full color using Google Chrome on Windows 11.
This method works consistently and avoids using any third‑party PDF applications.
